On some computers the device cannot be plugged-in, errors:

Connecting via usb hub makes it work. As far as I investigated it relates to the current level the device pulls.

Unlike other devices, specifications is [http://www.datasheet4u.net/datasheet/S/P/I/SPIF225A_Sunplus.pdf.html available].

== Installation ==

Standard USB mass storage device with automatic quirks.

== Issues ==

Device must be plugged-in before hard disk power is connected.

Device comes without power supply, so I had to buy [[USB_SATA_JM20337]] just for the power supply.

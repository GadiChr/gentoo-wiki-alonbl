= Bluetooth Modem =

Bluetooth modems are very common, especially common when cellular phone is bluetooth enabled.

== Configuration ==

First setup core [[Bluetooth|bluetooth]].

{{Kernel||<pre>
  [*] Networking support  --->
    <M>   Bluetooth subsystem support  --->
      <M>   RFCOMM protocol support
      [*]     RFCOMM TTY support
</pre>}}

Add:
{{File|/etc/conf.d/modules|<pre>
modules="${modules} bluethooth"
</pre>}}

== Device Attach ==

Attach you modem as any regular device see [[Bluetooth]].

== Setup rfcomm ==

Assuming device address is 00:24:7C:2F:92:7C, add entry:
{{File|/etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf|<pre>
rfcomm0 {
        bind yes;
        device 00:24:7C:2F:92:7C;
        channel 4;
        comment "My phone";
}
</pre>}}

The tricky is to find the channel number, if you don't have documentation of device, simply start of 0 and increment while testing.

Restart bluetooth:
{{Root|/etc/init.d/bluetooth restart}}

== Test ==

Test using {{Package|net-misc/taylor-uucp}}
{{Root|emerge net-misc/taylor-uucp}}

Simply enter "AT" and expect for "OK", to exit use "~." sequence.
{{Root|cu -l /dev/rfcomm0}}
{{Codeline|<pre>
# cu -l /dev/rfcomm0 
Connected.
AT
OK
!.
</pre>}}

== Network ==

Now you can configure [[PPP_Client|ppp]] to be used with modem.
